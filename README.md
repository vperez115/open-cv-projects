## Round 1

1. **Facial Feature Art Project:** Students will create an artistic representation by detecting and manipulating facial features in images. This project emphasizes understanding facial recognition techniques in OpenCV.

2. **Dynamic Color Filtering Art:** This project involves creating art through dynamic color filtering. Students will learn to isolate and manipulate specific colors in images or video streams, showcasing creative uses of color segmentation.

3. **Motion Capture Artistic Display:** Utilizing motion detection capabilities of OpenCV, students will create an artistic display that responds to motion, highlighting their understanding of motion tracking algorithms.

4. **Pattern and Texture Synthesis Project:** In this project, students will experiment with creating unique patterns or textures using image transformations and blending techniques. It focuses on advanced image processing skills like texture synthesis and pattern generation.
